# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-and-publish-head:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    #if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' # Running this job only for develop branch
